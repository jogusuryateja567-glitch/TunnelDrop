P2P Instant File Transfer Platform

1. Executive Summary
Product Name: TunnelDrop (working title)
Vision: Build the world's fastest file transfer service by eliminating server-side storage entirely and creating direct peer-to-peer connections between devices.
Core Value Proposition:

Zero upload wait time—downloads begin instantly
No file size limits
Complete privacy (no server storage)
Works across all devices and platforms
Local network discovery for same-location transfers

Target Launch: MVP in 8-12 weeks

2. Problem Statement
Current Pain Points

Double Latency: Traditional services (WeTransfer, Google Drive) require full upload before download can begin
Artificial Limits: File size caps (2GB-100GB) based on business models
Privacy Concerns: Files stored on third-party servers, subject to scanning/monitoring
Cross-Platform Friction: AirDrop only works Apple-to-Apple; alternatives are clunky
Account Barriers: Most services require sign-up, reducing spontaneous sharing

User Scenarios

Hostel/College: Students sharing large files (movies, games, project files) within same building
Office: Colleagues transferring large datasets without email/Slack limits
Events/Conferences: Quick file sharing between attendees
Cross-device: Personal transfers between own devices without cloud middleman


3. Solution Overview
Core Technology
WebRTC Data Channels for direct browser-to-browser communication with:

STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal (minimal infrastructure)
Signaling server for connection handshake only
No file data touches our servers

Key Differentiators

Instant Start: Receiver begins downloading while sender is still "uploading"
True Unlimited: No file size restrictions (limited only by device storage)
Privacy-First: Zero-knowledge architecture
Universal Compatibility: Works on any device with a modern browser
Local Discovery: Automatic peer detection on same network

6.3 WebRTC Connection Logic
javascript// Pseudo-code

// Sender
const peer = new SimplePeer({ initiator: true });
peer.on('signal', data => {
  socket.emit('signal', { room: code, signal: data });
});
peer.on('connect', () => {
  // Stream file in chunks
  streamFile(file, peer);
});

// Receiver
const peer = new SimplePeer({ initiator: false });
socket.on('signal', data => {
  peer.signal(data);
});
peer.on('data', chunk => {
  // Reconstruct file
  appendChunk(chunk);
});
6.4 Scalability Considerations

Signaling Server: Handles only handshakes, not file data. Can scale horizontally.
TURN Relay: Only used when P2P fails (~10-20% of connections). Bandwidth cost is main concern.
Cost Projection:

90% of transfers: $0 (pure P2P)
10% via TURN: ~$0.05/GB (Twilio pricing)
If 10,000 transfers/day @ 1GB avg, 1000 via TURN = $50/day = $1500/month



Mitigation:

Encourage local network use (no TURN needed)
Rate limit: 5 transfers/hour per IP
Premium tier for heavy users (future)


7. Privacy & Security
7.1 Privacy Features
Zero-Knowledge Architecture:

Files never stored on servers
Signaling server sees only: timestamp, room codes, IP addresses (temp)
No analytics on file contents

Data Retention:

Room codes: Deleted after 10 minutes or transfer completion
Logs: 24-hour rolling window (for debugging only)
No user accounts = no user data

7.2 Security Measures
In Transit:

WebRTC is encrypted by default (DTLS-SRTP)
Signaling over WSS (WebSocket Secure)

Code Security:

4-digit codes (10,000 combinations) expire quickly (5 min)
Rate limiting on code attempts (10/minute per IP)

Future:

Optional password protection
SHA-256 file verification (sender/receiver compare hashes)

7.3 Legal/Compliance
GDPR/Privacy:

No personal data collected
Privacy policy: "We don't see your files, period."

DMCA/Abuse:

No ability to monitor content (by design)
Terms of Service: "Don't share illegal content"
Abuse contact: If notified, can block IP/device (temporary)

Jurisdiction:

US-based legal entity (simpler compliance)

Key Insight: We're combining the best of Snapdrop (P2P, no storage) + AirDrop (local speed) + better UX (codes/QR instead of name-based discovery).

13.2 FAQ for Stakeholders
Q: How is this different from Snapdrop?
A: Snapdrop requires both users to be on the exact same page at the exact same time and identifies by device names (confusing in large groups). TunnelDrop uses explicit codes/QR for clarity and works even if users aren't on the same network (via TURN fallback).
Q: Won't this be used for piracy?
A: Potentially, but we have no more control than email or Dropbox. Our ToS prohibits illegal use, and we can't monitor content (by design). Legally, we're a "mere conduit" like an ISP.
Q: How do you make money?
A: Phase 1 is growth-focused (free). Phase 2 introduces optional premium features (history sync, custom codes, apps). Business tier for teams.
Q: What if the signaling server goes down?
A: Transfers in progress continue (they're P2P). New transfers fail gracefully with error message. We'll use uptime monitoring and have auto-restart configured.

13.3 Open Questions

Brand Name: Is "TunnelDrop" final, or do we workshop alternatives? (Examples: ZipZap, FileBeam, PeerSend)
Premium Launch Timing: Introduce paid tier at 10K users or 100K users?
Mobile Apps Priority: Build PWA first or jump to native apps?
Partnerships: Approach router manufacturers (TP-Link, Netgear) for bundling?


14. Conclusion
TunnelDrop has the potential to redefine file sharing by eliminating the server middleman and delivering true instant transfers. The combination of radical simplicity, privacy-by-design, and local network discovery creates a product that's both technically superior and emotionally resonant ("finally, file sharing that just works").
Next Steps:

Finalize tech stack decisions (week 1)
Set up development environment and repo (week 1)
Build signaling server MVP (week 2)
Begin frontend development (week 2-3)
Weekly check-ins to review progress vs. roadmap

Success depends on:

Flawless UX (every step must feel instant)
Aggressive early marketing to students
Local Drop feature launching before competitors copy the idea
